Basic get-you-up-and-running instructions.

REQUIREMENTS

 * Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.2 (caveat emptor: delayed_job won't work with 1.9.2)
 * RubyGems ~> 1.3.7
 * bundler gem ~> 1.0.0.rc.6 (install with gem install bundler --pre)
 * MySQL, including client libraries (e.g. libmysqlclient-dev on Debian)

Additionally, on Debian:

 * ruby1.8-dev (to get mkmf.rb, which is not in the ruby1.8 package)
 * libopenssl-ruby1.8
 * libxml2
 * libxslt

DEBIAN INSTRUCTIONS

First obtain a set of required packages from apt:
apt-get install build-essential git-core ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev rubygems1.8 mysql-server-5.0 libmysqlclient15-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libxslt1.1 libopenssl-ruby1.8

The version of RubyGems in apt is unfortunately out of date. This can be remedied with:
gem install rubygems-update
cd /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
./update_rubygems

Now, install required gems:
gem install bundler --pre

SETUP

1. Grab the source:

  $ git clone git://github.com/oneclickorgs/one-click-orgs.git
  $ cd one-click-orgs

2. Install the required gems using Bundler:

  $ bundle install  # installs gem system-wide

or

  $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle # vendors everything, no system gems

3. Create your local config files:

  $ rake oco:generate_config

4. Set up your database connection settings, by editing config/database.yml as desired.

If your database user doesn't have CREATE DATABASE permissions, create the databases manually, e.g.:

  $ mysql -u root -p
  mysql> create database one_click_development;
  mysql> create database one_click_test;
  mysql> exit;

5. (Create and) migrate the database:

  $ rake db:setup

RUNNING

1. Start the web server:

  $ bundle exec rails server

2. (Optional) In another shell, start the job server (which sends emails and closes proposals):

  $ script/delayed_job run       # run in foreground
  $ script/delayed_job start     # start as daemon (check log/delayed_job.log)
  $ rake jobs:work    # forground, from rake
  $ rake jobs:clear   # clear queue

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/

UPDATING

When you pull updates from the repository, you may need to update your gem bundle (if Gemfile.lock has changed) and/or migrate your database (if db/migrate has changed):

$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate

These commands will safely no-op if no changes are necessary.
