Basic get-you-up-and-running instructions.

REQUIREMENTS

 * Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.2 (caveat emptor: delayed_job won't work with 1.9.2)
 * RubyGems ~> 1.3.7
 * bundler gem ~> 1.0.0.rc.6 (install with gem install bundler --pre)
 * MySQL, including client libraries (e.g. libmysqlclient-dev on Debian)

Additionally, on Debian:

 * ruby1.8-dev (to get mkmf.rb, which is not in the ruby1.8 package)
 * libopenssl-ruby1.8
 * libxml2
 * libxslt

DEBIAN INSTRUCTIONS

First obtain a set of required packages from apt:
apt-get install build-essential git-core ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev rubygems1.8 mysql-server-5.0 libmysqlclient15-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libxslt1.1 libopenssl-ruby1.8

The version of RubyGems in apt is unfortunately out of date. This can be remedied with:
gem install rubygems-update
cd /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
./update_rubygems

Now, install required gems:
gem install bundler --pre

SETUP

1. Grab the source:

  $ git clone git://github.com/oneclickorgs/one-click-orgs.git
  $ cd one-click-orgs

2. Install the required gems using Bundler:

  $ bundle install  # installs gem system-wide

or

  $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle # vendors everything, no system gems

3. Create your local config files:

  $ rake oco:generate_config

4. Set up your database connection settings, by editing config/database.yml as desired.

If your database user doesn't have CREATE DATABASE permissions, create the databases manually, e.g.:

  $ mysql -u root -p
  mysql> create database one_click_development;
  mysql> create database one_click_test;
  mysql> exit;

5. (Create and) migrate the database:

  $ rake db:setup

RUNNING

1. Start the web server:

  $ bundle exec rails server

2. (Optional) In another shell, start the job server (which sends emails and closes proposals):

  $ script/delayed_job run       # run in foreground
  $ script/delayed_job start     # start as daemon (check log/delayed_job.log)
  $ rake jobs:work    # forground, from rake
  $ rake jobs:clear   # clear queue

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/

You can just choose 'single organisation mode', or if you want to test multi-tenancy mode, you'll need lines in your hosts file point yourorganisation.localhost, etc. to 127.0.0.1.

UPDATING

When you pull updates from the repository, you may need to update your gem bundle (if Gemfile.lock has changed) and/or migrate your database (if db/migrate has changed):

$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate

These commands will safely no-op if no changes are necessary.

CONTRIBUTING

Before you submit any patches make sure that no tests fail:

  $ rake spec

To submit a patch, you have several options:

a. Put your changes in a branch with an appropriate name, and push it to your GitHub repository, and send a pull request to chrismear.

b. Open or reply to an issue in the issue tracker, and tell us where to find your commits:
