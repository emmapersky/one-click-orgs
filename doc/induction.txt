http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues#issue/118 "Update induction process to use interface closer to core app"
See "One Click Orgs v1.0 Requirements" on Google Docs for functional spec.

A new organisation is in a "pending" state until the founder marks it as "complete".
In this state:
- the founder can modify the organisation/consitution without making proposals
- the founder can add new founding members without making proposals
- there is a prominent message that highlights this, and a button to finalise
- founding members can log in and view the consitution, but cannot make changes

Once the founder marks the organisation as "complete":
- Changes now require a proposal
- Members have full access to the system

http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues/#issue/58 "Multi-org templating: allow the one codebase to support multiple types of organisation"

tbd. 

(For now let's do a quick implementation of #118 and use this to highlight more
detailed requirements for #58.)


 =====================
 = Induction Process =
 =====================

Member class: "founder"
Founder has all possible perms
Founder has new perm: "make changes without proposal"
Founder has new perm: "create proposal to found org"

Member class: "founding member"
Founding member has only one, new perm: "vote on 'found org' proposal"

new banner: "pending org" message, and "found org now" button
-> Confirmation dialogue
- create 'found org' proposal
- migrate founder to 'founding member' class' to prevent org changes

when 'found org' proposal failed:
- founding members can log in, view the constitution, will see a 'founding vote failed' message

when 'found org' proposal succeeded:
- all founding members who voted 'yes' or who abstained (including the founder) get migrated to full 'member' status
- all other founding members receive an email 'sorry that you don't want to be a part of this'
  - do we need/want to disable these accounts?

CURRENT STATE

DONE
* code cleanup of misc controller clause setters/getters
  * co.clauses.get_current||new, set, save!  -> co.clauses.set_text
* new simple induction: one form for founder and org
* new proposal to found org
* new perm and before_filter: found_organisation_permission
* new state and before_filter: organisation_pending
* various controller/model/view changes for the above
* fixed misc typos
* ...?

IN PROGRESS 
* reorganise induction process according to spec

current steps:
* select org subdomain at /organisations/new
* provide founder details, create account at /induction/founder
* provide org name, objectives, asset flag at /induction/organisation_details
* provide founding members' email, name at /induction/members
* select governance parameters (voting settings) at /induction/voting_settings
* preview org at /induction/preview_constitution
* set up founding meeting at /induction/founding_meeting_details
* preview founding meeting agenda at /induction/preview_agenda
* report founding meeting results at /induction/founding_meeting
* done.

goal:
* one intro/setup page, cf spec
  * done: org details
  * done: founding member details
  * todo later: better form highlighting/flashes (multi-flash, highlight form fields)
  * todo: migrate+redirect to pending stage
* todo: pending stage
* todo: "found org" proposal

WHERE I LEFT IT LAST TIME:
* just finished new setup form for (org, founder): controllers/organisation_controller.rb, views/organisation/new.html.haml
  * should write some tests for OrganisationsController#create, and the org/member/member_class/constitution models
  * should fix broken tests (esp. where code was removed)
* BUG: after creating an org, re-visiting /organisations/new to create the next one leads to a NPE which can be resolved by destroying the current session. -> what's the best fix?
* next: how to support both "direct edit" changes and "proposal process" changes without duplicating too much code?
  * different wording, same forms; effect is immediate vs. delayed
  * should "direct edit" changes show up in timeline? should members get emailed? (to demo live behaviour)
    * if so: should timeline get cleared before org goes live?
  * e.g. send to different controller? like /proposals, but for direct edit
    * can only be called in pending state

cleanup later:
* remove all traces of old induction: controller, view, layout, etc (?)
* update unit tests before proceeding! (throw away old ones, write new ones)
  * all induction tests still need to be written
* check latest 1.0 spec and verify our wording, workflow, etc is according to spec
* How can we validate Member.password? it's accepted as form value, but actually saved as crypted_password

TODO
* auto-select appropriate member classes during induction
  * "Founder" class at /induction/founder
  * "Founding Member" class at /induction/members
* remove dedicated timeline page during induction (currently it just throws a NPE)
* direct edit for:
  * members -> add
  * dashboard -> add member
  * settings/constitution
* skip 'has user been inducted?' before_filter if org is pending
  * causes 'Error casting vote: Can not vote on proposals created before member inducted'
* set org state to 'failed' if not enough members voted for it


TO RESET ORG STATE AND START INDUCTION
$ rake db:setup
$ ./script/rails server

-> http://oco:3000/ and follow instructions

(if request fails with "undefined method `members' for nil:NilClass" then delete current session/cookie)

SNIPPETS

# assign member classes, provided we already have members set up
Member.all
Member.all.each { |m| if m.id!=1 m.member_class = MemberClass.find_or_create_by_name('Founding Member'); m.save! }
Member.all.each { |m| if m.id=1 m.member_class = MemberClass.find_or_create_by_name('Founder'); m.save! }

# or just:
m = Member.find_by_id(1)
m.member_class = MemberClass.find_by_name('Founder'); m.save!

# set up org in pending state
o = Organisation.all.first
o.clauses.set_text('organisation_state', 'pending')

# when done with org setup:
o.clauses.set_text('organisation_state', 'proposed')
